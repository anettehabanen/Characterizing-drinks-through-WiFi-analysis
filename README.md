"Characterizing Drinks Through WiFI Anlysis" is a project where WiFi signals are used to diffrentiate between liquids.

This repositorium consists of two files:
* Characterizing_Drinks_through_WiFi_analysis.ipynb
** This has code for preprocessing data and training a model (CNN model).
* live_predictor.py
** This file has code that can do live predictions based on trained models.
